<p>Beer for art’s sake</p>
<h3 id="brewed-for-a-better-future">Brewed for a better future</h3>
<p><b>FAB</b> is the world that is realized in art and music. We are a gypsy brewery based out of Somerville and brewing at Dorchester Brewing in Boston. Our mission is to create beers which realize the unique visions of  artists in our community and then bring these artworks to life in ways which reflects the intention of that artist, and that piece.</p>

<p>FAB is our brewery. <a href="/babydictators" class="fancy bd-text">THE BABY DICTATORS PROJECT</a> is our first can series, which satirizes aspiring dictators by exploring their alternative-reality possible futures if they had had happier childhoods.</p>

<p>Our idea is that the art that we create is a mirror of the world which we wish to live in. The first step is to create cans which are galleries for art-makers. The second step is to follow up on these artworks, investing can sales to transform artistic visions into to public art projects and sculpture at grand scales.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-project">Our first project</h3>

<p>Is the <strong class="bd-text fancy"><a href="/babydictators">BABY DICTATORS PROJECT</a></strong>. We’re creating cans which invent satirical BABY DICTATOR BALLOONS. Balloons will be fabricated and flown at activist events and political rallies in the USA election year 2020. The first two balloons are <em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em>  and <em class="sqp-text fancy">SQUID PRO QUO</em>. Using can sales to fund art and fabrication, we will create enough balloons to replace 100-fold the “Baby Trump” protest artwork which was destroyed at an LSU Football Game.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to reinforce artistic resiliency and free protest on a national scale. Its mascot is MEDUSA BALLOON, created by Adam O’Day.</p>

<h1 id="beers">BEERS</h1>
<p>Ben and Todd created the recipes for our first two beers. <em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em> is a West Coast-style IPA and <em class="sqp-text fancy">SQUID PRO QUO</em> is a Double IPA. Both beers are brimming with hops from the American Northwest. Each of these first recipes employs mash hopping, a technique which we are curious about (see below). These beers are also dry hopped at two points–once, during the height of fermentation activity to promote the integration of resinous hop terpenes into the flavor of the beer, and secondly, at the tail end of fermentation–immediately following which addition, the beer is capped to capture the hop aromas, with the secondary benefit of naturally carbonating the beer, from the trace amounts of fermentable sugars present in the hop flowers.

<span class="technique-content toggle-target" id="mash-hop-target">Both <em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em> and <em class="sqp-text fancy">SQUID PRO QUO</em> are mash hopped beers. Mash hopping involves the addition of hops (in this case, Citra) at the very beginning of beer brewing. These hops are added at relatively low temperatures, allowing extraction into the beer of many sought after aroma compounds in addition to some plant sugars which are found in the hop flowers. Mash hop plant matter is discarded before the beer is boiled and our early experiments point to this reducing the extraction of harsh bitterness which can result from hop additions during the boiling of wort. </span></p>

<em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em> is the first can in the Baby Dictators series. Created by Adam O’Day who lived for a time in Athens Georgia, we wanted the first beer in this series to take a step back from a literal rendering of the subject and to tell a different story… the <em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em> is a pretty dark place, from which the balloon escapes to greener pastures.</p>

  <h4 id="artists-statement">Artist’s statement:</h4>
  <p>“This baby Trump balloon is a very orange Georgia peach. The poor guy didn’t seem happy in the city. He is freed from a menacing urban landscape and drifts to a farm I painted in New Hampshire. The word farm has multiple meanings: retiring in peace… or going to jail.”<br />
–ADAM O’DAY, Balloon Factory, MA</p>

<em class="sqp-text fancy">SQUID PRO QUO</em> is the second can in the Baby Dictators series. It is created by artist / surfing teacher / oyster farmer / shark commentator, Andy Jacob in Wellfleet MA. Andy is one of the founders of this series, the purpose of which is to explore the alternate potential futures of baby Trump, had he only had a happier childhood. Andy took the concept of the series literally. The five surfer Trumps pulling <em class="sqp-text fancy">SQUID PRO QUO</em> in the artwork are alternate reality future Trumps who benefited from surfing lessons as kids and now live peacefully as professional surfers, riding the swells.</p>

  <p>“I imagined him floating over a psychedelic sunset, riding tubes in pure bliss. 5 alternate reality surfer Trumps guide the strings harmoniously. Like if he grew up surfing with his dad, going to the beach each weekend.”<br />

<p><img src="/assets/story/medusa_with_ruler_bw@0,25x.png" alt="Medusa With Ruler" class="img-responsive image image-medusa-ruler" /></p>

<p>MEDUSA BALLOON is the mascot for this series. It was imagined by Adam O’Day who is also an artist of <em class="bf-text fancy">BALLOON FACTORY</em>, the first baby dictator. We are not sure how to fabricate MEDUSA BALLOON, as the shape is outrageously complicated. A perfect MEDUSA BALLOON, would probably work like this guy:</p>
