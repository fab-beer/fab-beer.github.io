Beer for art’s sake
### BREWED FOR A BETTER FUTURE ###
FAB is the world that is realized in art and music. We are a gypsy brewing project based out of Dorchester Brewing Company in Boston, MA. Our mission is to create beers for the sake of art, which realize the unique visions of the artists which are part of our community and then bring these artworks to life in the real world in a way which reflects the intention of that artist, and that piece. 

Our idea is that the world which we wish to see is a mirror of the art that we create. The first step of this process is to create galleries and financial support for the art-makers. Our cans are our art galleries, and our sales fund their creation. The second step of this process is to follow up on these artworks, growing them up from can artworks to public art projects, sometimes at grand scales. 
# OUR FIRST PROJECT #
Is the Baby Dictators Project. The goal of this project is to create one hundred unique BABY DICTATOR BALLOONS which will be flown at activist events and political rallies in the USA election year 2020. These balloons will replace 100-fold the “Baby Trump” protest artwork which was destroyed by LSU Football Game.

Our first project is to reinforce on a national scale the theme of artistic resiliency and free protest. This theme inspired MEDUSA BALLOON, our mascot.

## BABY DICTATOR BEERS ##
Ben and Todd designed the recipe for our first two beers. BALLOON FACTORY is a West Coast-style IPA and SQUID PRO QUO is a similar Double IPA. Both beers are brimming with hops from the American Northwest. Each of these first recipes employs mash hopping, a technique which we are curious about (see below). These beers are also dry hopped at two points--once, during the height of fermentation activity to promote the integration of resinous hop terpenes into the flavor of the beer, and secondly, at the tail end of fermentation--immediately following which addition, the beer is capped to capture the hop aromas, with the secondary benefit of naturally carbonating the beer, from the trace amounts of fermentable sugars present in the hop flowers.
### MASH HOPPING ###
Both BALLOON FACTORY and SQUID PRO QUO are mash hopped beers. Mash hopping involves the addition of hops (in this case, Citra) at the very beginning of beer brewing. These hops are added at relatively low temperatures, allowing extraction into the beer of many sought after aroma compounds in addition to some plant sugars which are found in the hop flowers. Mash hop plant matter is discarded before the beer is boiled and our early experiments point to this reducing the extraction of harsh bitterness which can result from hop additions during the boiling of wort. 

## BABY DICTATOR BALLOONS ##
Adam O’Day and Andy Jacobs imagined the first two Baby Dictator Balloons, named “BALLOON FACTORY” and “SQUID PRO QUO”, respectively. These balloons are represented on our first two cans. 

### BALLOON FACTORY ###
BALLOON FACTORY is the first can in the Baby Dictators series. Created by Adam O’Day who lived for a time in Athens Georgia, we wanted the first beer in this series to take a step back from a literal rendering of the subject and to tell a different story… the BALLOON FACTORY is a pretty dark place, from which the balloon escapes to greener pastures. 
#### ARTIST’S STATEMENT:  ####
“This baby Trump balloon is a very orange Georgia peach. The poor guy didn’t seem happy in the city. He is freed from a menacing urban landscape and drifts to a farm I painted in New Hampshire. The word farm has multiple meanings: retiring in peace... or going to jail.”
--ADAM O’DAY, Balloon Factory, MA

### SQUID PRO QUO ###
SQUID PRO QUO is the second can in the Baby Dictators series. It is created by artist / surfing teacher / oyster farmer / shark commentator, Andy Jacob in Wellfleet MA. Andy is one of the founders of this series, the purpose of which is to explore the alternate potential futures of baby Trump, had he only had a happier childhood. Andy took the concept of the series literally. The five surfer Trumps pulling SQUID PRO QUO in the artwork are alternate reality future Trumps who benefited from surfing lessons as kids and now live peacefully as professional surfers, riding the swells. 
#### ARTIST’S STATEMENT #### 
“I imagined him floating over a psychedelic sunset, riding tubes in pure bliss. 5 alternate reality surfer Trumps guide the strings harmoniously. Like if he grew up surfing with his dad, going to the beach each weekend.”
--ANDREW JACOBS, Wellfleet Mass.

### REACH GOAL: MEDUSA BALLOON ###
MEDUSA BALLOON is the mascot for this series. It was imagined by Adam O’Day who is also an artist of BALLOON FACTORY, the first Balloon in the Baby Dictators can series. We are not sure how to fabricate MEDUSA BALLOON… if you have any advice for us, please email: fabrication-advice@fab.beer

# STORE #
In addition to making balloons and beer, we also created a store where you can pick up cool gear for both FAB and the BABY DICTATORS PROJECT. The store is launching on 12/3/2019. Check it out then.
