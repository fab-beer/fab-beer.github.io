Beer for art’s sake
### Brewed for a better future ###

<b>FAB</b> is the world that is realized in art and music. We are a gypsy brewery, "<b>F</b>ermentation <b>A</b>rts <b>B</b>rasserie", based out of Somerville and brewing at Dorchester Brewing in Boston. Our mission is to create beers which realize the unique visions of  artists in our community and then bring these artworks to life in ways which reflects the intention of that artist, and that piece. 


Our idea is that the art that we create is a mirror of the world which we wish to live in. The first step is to create cans which are galleries for art-makers. The second step is to follow up on these artworks, investing can sales to transform artistic visions into to public art projects and sculpture at grand scales.

### Our first project ###

Is the **[BABY DICTATORS PROJECT](/babydictators)**{:class="bd-text fancy"}. We're creating cans which invent satirical BABY DICTATOR BALLOONS. Balloons will be fabricated and flown at activist events and political rallies in the USA election year 2020. The first two balloons are *BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"}  and *SQUID PRO QUO*{:class="sqp-text fancy"}. Using can sales to fund art and fabrication, we will create enough balloons to replace 100-fold the “Baby Trump” protest artwork which was destroyed at an LSU Football Game.

The purpose of this project is to reinforce artistic resiliency and free protest on a national scale. Its mascot is MEDUSA BALLOON, created by Adam O'Day. More on MEDUSA BALLOON below...

# BEERS #
Ben and Todd created the recipes for our first two beers. *BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"} is a West Coast-style IPA and *SQUID PRO QUO*{:class="sqp-text fancy"} is a Double IPA. Both beers are brimming with hops from the American Northwest. Each of these first recipes employs mash hopping, a technique which we are curious about (see below). These beers are also dry hopped at two points--once, during the height of fermentation activity to promote the integration of resinous hop terpenes into the flavor of the beer, and secondly, at the tail end of fermentation--immediately following which addition, the beer is capped to capture the hop aromas, with the secondary benefit of naturally carbonating the beer, from the trace amounts of fermentable sugars present in the hop flowers.
*[+] Learn about Mash Hopping*{:class="technique-header toggle-button" target-id="mash-hop-target"}
<span class="technique-content toggle-target" id="mash-hop-target">Both *BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"} and *SQUID PRO QUO*{:class="sqp-text fancy"} are mash hopped beers. Mash hopping involves the addition of hops (in this case, Citra) at the very beginning of beer brewing. These hops are added at relatively low temperatures, allowing extraction into the beer of many sought after aroma compounds in addition to some plant sugars which are found in the hop flowers. Mash hop plant matter is discarded before the beer is boiled and our early experiments point to this reducing the extraction of harsh bitterness which can result from hop additions during the boiling of wort. </span>



###  *[BALLOON FACTORY](/cans/bf)*{:class="bf-text fancy can-section"} ###

*BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"} is the first can in the Baby Dictators series. Created by Adam O’Day who lived for a time in Athens Georgia, we wanted the first beer in this series to take a step back from a literal rendering of the subject and to tell a different story… the *BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"} is a pretty dark place, from which the balloon escapes to greener pastures.

> #### Artist's statement:  ####
> “This baby Trump balloon is a very orange Georgia peach. The poor guy didn’t seem happy in the city. He is freed from a menacing urban landscape and drifts to a farm I painted in New Hampshire. The word farm has multiple meanings: retiring in peace... or going to jail.”  
> --ADAM O’DAY, Balloon Factory, MA  


### *[SQUID PRO QUO](/cans/sqp)*{:class="sqp-text fancy can-section"} ###
<a href="/cans/sqp">![SQP can](/assets/canart/cans_sqp_tall_can.png){:class="img-responsive can-image image left-image image-200"}</a>
*SQUID PRO QUO*{:class="sqp-text fancy"} is the second can in the Baby Dictators series. It is created by artist / surfing teacher / oyster farmer / shark commentator, Andy Jacob in Wellfleet MA. Andy is one of the founders of this series, the purpose of which is to explore the alternate potential futures of baby Trump, had he only had a happier childhood. Andy took the concept of the series literally. The five surfer Trumps pulling *SQUID PRO QUO*{:class="sqp-text fancy"} in the artwork are alternate reality future Trumps who benefited from surfing lessons as kids and now live peacefully as professional surfers, riding the swells.

> “I imagined him floating over a psychedelic sunset, riding tubes in pure bliss. 5 alternate reality surfer Trumps guide the strings harmoniously. Like if he grew up surfing with his dad, going to the beach each weekend.”

### REACH GOAL: MEDUSA BALLOON ###
MEDUSA BALLOON is the mascot for this series. It was imagined by Adam O’Day who is also an artist of *BALLOON FACTORY*{:class="bf-text fancy"}, the first baby dictator. We are not sure how to fabricate MEDUSA BALLOON, as the shape is outrageously complicated. A perfect MEDUSA BALLOON, would probably work like this guy:

# STORE #
In addition to making balloons and beer, we also created a store where you can pick up cool gear for both FAB and the  **[BABY DICTATORS PROJECT](/babydictators)**{:class="bd-text fancy"}. The store is launching on 12/3/2019. Check it out then.
