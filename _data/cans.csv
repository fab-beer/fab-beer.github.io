In-keeping with the American Pilsner style, P4P's assertive hoppiness is infused in multiple stages of mash- and biotransformational, ""High Krausen"" dry-hopping. Clean and easy-drinking, with some sweetness and counter-balancing bitterness, the PILSNER 4 PEACE is envisioned as an international open-source collaboration beer. Participating breweries are invited to collaborate on this open recipe, and all they have to do is pay local artists a fair price to contribute to our global art series.

Biotransformed by vigorous fermentation with our East Coast // New England IPA yeasts. TREMENDOUS, FAB's first 2xIPA explores many dimensions of hop additions. A blend of hops including juicy-tropical Mosaic, and grapefruit-citrusy Citra, are first added at 155F in the mash for early integration of flavorful trichomes and boosted in multiple rounds of whirlpool- and dry-hopping for aroma capture and flavor amplification. Adding hops during the height of fermentation and carefully controlling temperatures, we maximize hop aroma and gather natural CO2 in steel for flavorful, champagne-like effervescence, balanced flavor, and delicate sweetness.",['mars'],1/17,,,,,,,
