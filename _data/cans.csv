Join our passion-fruity exploration of pure mosaic hopes. Marvel was originally the culmination of a series of pre-launch experiment to create a single hop beer on a nuanced and flavorful grain bill.

Complementing the complex grain bill, the hop bill is 100% USA mosaic, added over the course of fermentation, focusing on high krausen",,,,,,,,,

Effervescent, citrusy, with sweetness balanced by assertive bitterness, this beer would represent a return to traditional IPA roots if added to our portfolio. Of course, clocking in at 9%, featuring cryo hops, and a collaboration of old and new world yeasts, it does have some surprises up its sleeve.",,,,,,,,,
