                    <p>Our favorite local bars and restaurants are suffering from 
                        a completely unprecedented challenge to afford their costs and 
                        pay staff during the current Covid 19 medical crisis. Understanding
                        the current extreme circumstances, several states including NY and Maine
                        have enacted emergency legislation in order to protect business owners
                        and help them pay employees by letting on-premises establishments
                        sell alcohol at their storefronts and via delivery to customers 
                        to consume in their homes. 
                    </p><p>Together with Somerville's rep 
                    <b>Denise Provost</b> and our favorite establishments, FAB asks
                    Governor Charlie Baker to sign an emergency executive order which
                    will allow bars and restaurants to add delivery and take-away alcohol
                    in closed containers to their menu. Restaurants and bars will place a
                    focus on staff and customer safety above all else, and carefully implement
                    this plan to add revenue to take-away orders which are already happening,
                    in order to support staff and pay overhead during the crisis.
