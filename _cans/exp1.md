description: Created as the inaugural can of our 2022 launch experimental series,
  this beer is an exquisite fermentation. Using a combination of the hot-fermenting
  Nordic Kviek yeast with a West Coast strain, hops were added during high fermentation
  and continuously after. Effervescent, citrusy, with sweetness balanced by assertive
  bitterness, this beer would represent a return to traditional IPA roots if added
  to our portfolio. Of course, clocking in at 9%, featuring cryo hops, and a collaboration
  of old and new world yeasts, it does have some surprises up its sleeve.
