description: Welcome to the world of the marvel, and the passionfruity tropical exploration of the world of pure mosaic hops, infused into East Coast IPA goodness.<par>Marvel was an experiment to create a single hop beer on a simple grain bill which was roughly 80% GP+PILS blend, and 20% two row, not including other adjuncts for haze, acidity balance, and mouthfeel (flaked oats and acidulated malts for these properties). This used mosaic hops only, but we are thinking about extending this series in the future to include other hops such as Sabro.<par> Lemon and peach gummies with over-ripe strawberry aroma. Near purple drink notes are prominent. Honey nut cheerios malt aroma. Yeast esters underline and melds with Mosaicâ€™s fruit candy notes. Medium body, with fruit-cocktail flavors. Tangy fruitiness lingers with little to no bitterness.
