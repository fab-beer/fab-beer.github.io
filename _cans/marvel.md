description: In the wild world of the Marvel, passion is king. Join our passion-fruity
  exploration of pure mosaic hopes. Marvel was originally the culmination of a series
  of pre-launch experiment to create a single hop beer on a nuanced and flavorful
  grain bill. Roughly, 80% of the malt is an even blend of USA Golden promise and
  Pilsner malts with additions of two row, and other adjuncts for haze, acidity balance
  and mouth feel. Complementing the complex grain bill, the hop bill is 100% USA mosaic,
  added over the course of fermentation, focusing on high krausen
