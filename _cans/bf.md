description: "<em class=\"bf-text fancy\">BALLOON FACTORY</em> is the first can in\
  \ the Baby Dictators series. Created by Adam O\u2019Day who lived for a time in\
  \ Athens Georgia, we wanted the first beer in this series to take a step back from\
  \ a literal rendering of the subject and to tell a different story\u2026 the <em\
  \ class=\"bf-text fancy\">BALLOON FACTORY</em> is a pretty dark place, from which\
  \ the balloon escapes to greener pastures.</p>"

statement: "\u201CThis baby Trump balloon is a very orange Georgia peach. The poor\
  \ guy didn\u2019t seem happy in the city. He is freed from a menacing urban landscape\
  \ and drifts to a farm I painted in New Hampshire. The word farm has multiple meanings:\
  \ retiring in peace... or going to jail.\u201D\n--ADAM O\u2019DAY, Balloon Factory,\
  \ MA\n@ADAM_ODAY"
