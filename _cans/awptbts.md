text_description: Hazy, Juicy New England 2xIPA (9%). Mosaic and Citra dry-hopped.
  Delicately Funky, from hot fermentations of Norwegian Ale Yeast in equal-input collaboration
  with Oslo Brewing Co. AWPTBTS is a one-of-a-kind New England IPA, infused with the
  slightly funky flavors of Norwegian ale yeasts from Oslo Brewing co. Mosaic and
  citra hops are added at multiple stages, starting in The earliest steps of the mash
  continuing through multiple rounds of dry hopping during vigorous fermentation to
  create suspension of fine haze and juicy flavor. The fermenting beer is capped 24
  hours before the end of fermentation in order to capture naturally occurring carbon
  dioxide and maximize flavor and aroma potential. This creates a fine, prickly carbonation
  and a delicious champagne-like effervescence. The balanced grain bill comprised
  of golden promise and pilsner malts provide a delicate sweetness balancing delicious
  hop character, complimenting delicate funkiness, massive tropical juiciness, New
  England haze, and a crisp clean finish for a 9% ABV Norwegian-American monster.
