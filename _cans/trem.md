description: New England Double IPA (9%), brimming with passionfruit, citrus & pineapple
  flavors of Mosaic hops. Biotransformed by vigorous fermentation with our East Coast
  // New England IPA yeasts. TREMENDOUS, FAB's first 2xIPA explores many dimensions
  of hop additions. A blend of hops including juicy-tropical Mosaic, and grapefruit-citrusy
  Citra, are first added at 155F in the mash for early integration of flavorful trichomes
  and boosted in multiple rounds of whirlpool- and dry-hopping for aroma capture and
  flavor amplification. Adding hops during the height of fermentation and carefully
  controlling temperatures, we maximize hop aroma and gather natural CO2 in steel
  for flavorful, champagne-like effervescence, balanced flavor, and delicate sweetness.
