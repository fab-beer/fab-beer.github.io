description: American-style Pilsner, with subtle layers of Mandarina Bavaria and Citra
  hops, created in partnership between brewers and international, activist artists.
  In-keeping with the American Pilsner style, P4P's assertive hoppiness is infused
  in multiple stages of mash- and biotransformational, "High Krausen" dry-hopping.
  Clean and easy-drinking, with some sweetness and counter-balancing bitterness, the
  PILSNER 4 PEACE is envisioned as an international open-source collaboration beer.
  Participating breweries are invited to collaborate on this open recipe, and all
  they have to do is pay local artists a fair price to contribute to our global art
  series. For more information, check out fab.beer/p4p
