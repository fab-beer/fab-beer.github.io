    <h4>THANK YOU</h4> 9/10/2020--we're open! Hello to our community! Hello to our friends!
    <br/>
    Everyone, we are so excited to be opening our doors at 118 Beacon Street, bringing you <span class="fresh">FOOD ART BEER</span>,
    an excursion into freshness and community immersion for our little project, FAB, which is known by many names.... FAB, 
    "Fermentation Arts Braserrie", and now... "Food Art Beer", or just "FAB" :)

    Here at FAB, it is our mission to bring you the freshest possible beer and food in a relaxing community-focused environment
    which showcases works of some of the greatest artists of the local region. 

    We want to thank all of you that joined us to build Food Art Beer, and bring life the vision of 
    bringing the freshest possible IPAs and Lagers out into the world and pairing them with incredible food.
    and to all you community members, we salute you! We look forward to seeing you tonight and enjoying 
    your company here for a long time!
<br/>👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
<br/>--BEN</div></div>
